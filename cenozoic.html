                <h2> Cenozoic Era </h2>
                <p>The current geological era, spanning from about 66 million years ago to the present day. It is 
                    often referred to as the "Age of Mammals" due to the diversification and dominance of mammals during this time and the extinction of other
                     non-mammal prehistoric creatures.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Climate Change </h2>
                <p> The Cenozoic saw dramatic shifts in climate, including periods of warming and cooling, as well as the formation and retreat of ice sheets. 
                    These changes greatly influenced the evolution of flora and fauna. These changes in climate made the prehistoric humans cool themselves off when it’s 
                    hot and produce warmth during the cold days.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Mammalian Evolution </h2>
                <p>The Cenozoic witnessed the evolution of modern mammalian groups, including primates, cetaceans (whales and dolphins), and hominids 
                    (ancestors of humans), which some of their fossils can be seen in museums today.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Mass Extinction </h2>
                <p>  While not as severe as previous mass extinctions, the Cenozoic saw significant disruptions to biodiversity, including the extinction of large mammals like mammoths 
                    and saber-toothed cats, along with other prehistoric mammals that we can’t see in our current timeline.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Human Evolution </h2>
                <p>  The latter part of the Cenozoic, particularly the Quaternary Period, is marked by the evolution and spread of early humans across the globe.</p>
