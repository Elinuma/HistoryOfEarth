                <h2> Hadean Eon </h2>
                <p>The Hadean Eon is the first eon that occurred around 4.6 - 4.0 billion years ago. Information about this time period is 
                    quite scarce because the oldest rocks that can tell us about this time have already been gone. The Hadean Eon is said to have been named 
                    from the Greek god of the underworld Hades because of the Earth’s hell-like condition at the time. This eon entailed the formation of Earth’s core, 
                    mantle and crust as well as the Moon. The atmosphere of the time is mainly composed of carbon dioxide and water vapor.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Earth’s Moon </h2>
                <p> The formation of the moon is still a mystery but scientists proposed multiple hypotheses on the 
                    formation of our moon.The most prevalent of which is the giant-impact hypothesis,this hypothesis proposes that a
                     celestial body half the size of Earth collided which resulted in the mixing and scattering of materials from the both of them
                      which is why both bodies are similarly in their materials composition and why Earth has a denser and thicker core than the moon.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Earth's Crust </h2>
                <p>As Earth cooled down from its initial molten state, crystallization started to occur 
                    from the materials in the Earth. As the outer layer of the Earth cooled, the minerals that had a high melting point 
                    created early slabs of crust but as Earth is still way too hot the slabs are easily absorbed in the magma of the Earth but as earth cooled down it 
                    started to form the primitive crust. As time passed Earth cooled and the less dense materials started to float to the surface creating the crust while the denser 
                    materials sank creating the mantle and the more denser materials like iron and nickel started to sink into the core of the Earth.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Earth's Water </h2>
                <p> The water on our Earth has multiple proposed origin like:
                    Volcanic Outgassing-which is a proposal that says the origin of our water came from the water vapor
                     from the volcanic emissions but this alone isn’t enough as the water vapor in volcanic emission is only 1% of the volume.</p>
                <p> Meteorites and Comets-which is a proposal that says the origin of water came from comets 
                    and meteorites that carried ice then crash-landed on Earth which melted and turned into either water or water vapor.</p>
                <p> However there is still no definitive answer for the origin of the water so it may be possible that all three of these sources are true.</p>
