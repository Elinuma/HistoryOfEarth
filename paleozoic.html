                <h2> Paleozoic Era </h2>
                <p>Paleozoic Era, major interval of geologic time that began 538.8 million years ago with the Cambrian explosion, 
                    an extraordinary diversification of marine animals, and ended about 252 million years ago with the end-Permian extinction, 
                    the greatest extinction event in Earth history. </p>
                <br>
                <h2> Life During Paleozoic </h2>
                <p> The Paleozoic Era is literally the era of “old life.” It lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago and is divided into six periods. 
                    Major events in each period of the Paleozoic Era are described in Figure below. The era began with a spectacular burst of new life. 
                    This is called the Cambrian explosion. The era ended with the biggest mass extinction the world had ever seen. This is known as the Permian extinction.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Cambrian Period </h2>
                <p>Following the Precambrian mass extinction, there was an explosion of new kinds of organisms in the Cambrian Period (544–505 million years ago). 
                    Many types of primitive animals called sponges evolved. Small ocean invertebrates called trilobites became abundant.</p>
                <p>Two representatives of more than fifty modern animal phyla from the 
                    Cambrian explosion are reef-building sponges  and early arthropods known as trilobites. 
                    Both were abundant during the Cambrian and later became extinct; however, the phyla they represent persist to this day.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Ordovician Period </h2>
                <p> During the next period, the Ordovician Period (505–440 million years ago), the oceans became filled with invertebrates of many types. 
                    Also during this period, the first fish evolved and plants colonized the land for the first time. But animals still remained in the water.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Silurian Period </h2>
                <p>During the Silurian Period (440–410 million years ago), corals appeared in the oceans, and fish continued to evolve. On land, vascular plants appeared. 
                    With special tissues to circulate water and other materials, these plants could grow larger than the earlier nonvascular plants.</p>
                <p>Cooksonia, a branching vascular plant with sporangia at the tips of each branch. Cooksonia fossils measure just centimeters in height and date from the Silurian period.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Devonian Period </h2>
                <p> During the Devonian Period (410–360 million years ago), the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat and 
                    stored food to help these plants survive. Seed plants eventually became the most common type of land plants. In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved.
                     They could breathe air when they raised their heads above water. Breathing would be necessary for animals to eventually colonize the land.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Carboniferous Period </h2>
                <p> During the Carboniferous Period (360–290 million years ago), widespread forests of huge plants left massive deposits of carbon that eventually turned to coal. 
                    The first amphibians evolved to move out of the water and colonize land, but they had to return to the water to reproduce. Soon after amphibians arose, the first 
                    reptiles evolved. They were the first animals that could reproduce on dry land.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> The Permian Period </h2>
                <p> During the Permian Period (290–245 million years ago), all the major land masses collided to form a supercontinent called Pangaea. 
                    Temperatures were extreme, and the climate was dry. Plants and animals evolved adaptations to dryness, such as waxy leaves or leathery skin to prevent water loss. 
                    The Permian Period ended with a mass extinction.</p>
