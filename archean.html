                <h2> Archean Eon </h2>
                <p>This eon, which lasted from 4.0 to 2.5 billion years ago, is the representative of 
                    the beginning of the rock record. Archean eon contains more robust rocks and fossil records.

                <h2> Late Heavy Bombardment </h2>
                <p> After the planets are formed there is evidence that a second spike of comets and asteroids impacted both the Earth and Moon resulting in the moon's craters and instability 
                    of the other bodies in our solar system due to them impacting said bodies.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> Origin of the Continents </h2>
                <p>In order for plate tectonics to work there must be first continents but the easiest way 
                    to acquire continental material is from assimilation and differentiation of existing continents. 
                    Answering the question of what came first is quite hard as the scarcity of our evidence of the time is proving 
                    to be a huge hurdle. However the best idea that we currently have is that lighter and less dense materials started to float
                     upwards while heavier and denser materials sank causing the layering of the Earth.</p>
                <p>The first evidence of Modern plate tectonics happened at the end of the Archean Eon.</p>
                <br>
                <h2> First Life on Earth </h2>
                <p> The first life on Earth existed during the late Hadean and the Early Archean Eon; it primarily consisted of microbes.</p>
                <p> There are multitude of hypotheses and theories about the origin of life some of which are life originated from hydrothermal 
                    vents with early life using chemosynthesis for sustenance.Another hypothesis is that the building blocks of life came from 
                    asteroids containing amino acids which is an essential part of creating life.</p>
